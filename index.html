  <p>
    I am a U.S. Department of Defense IT and satellite communications professional with extensive experience supporting
     Special Operations missions. My work spans cloud engineering (with a strong focus on Azure environments), enterprise
      networking, and satellite communications planning and operations. I have trained dozens of personnel on DoD SATCOM 
      systems and policies, supported numerous operational deployments and Combat Training Center rotations, and developed
       practical troubleshooting guides for systems ranging from iDirect modems to Starlink.
    I am also deeply invested in professional development â€” maintaining certifications like CCNA, Security+, and AZ-104,
     while attending industry conferences to stay ahead of emerging technologies. Outside of work, I enjoy digging into hands-on
      technical projects, like automotive performance tuning and custom EFI setups, where I get to merge precision, data, and
       mechanical creativity. I am also a huge aviation nerd. I am a frequesnt user of ADSB exhange and FlightRadar24 for tracking aircraft.
    Both civilian, and some military. Though not all millitary flights will be visible, as they often disable their transponders for troop movements and training.
